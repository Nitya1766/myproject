      <h1>CUSTOMER SERVICE</h1>
      <p>Customer service is the assistance and advice provided by a company to those people who buy or use its products or services. Each industry requires different levels of customer service,[1] but in the end, the idea of a well-performed service is that of increasing revenues. The perception of success of the customer service interactions is dependent on employees "who can adjust themselves to the personality of the customer".[2] Customer service is often practiced in a way that reflects the strategies and values of a firm. Good quality customer service is usually measured through customer retention. Customer service for some firms is part of the firmâ€™s intangible assets and can differentiate it from others in the industry. One good customer service experience can change the entire perception a customer holds towards the organization</p>
